# Is digitCreate a window that will ask the

user to enter a number in a text box.
When they click on a button it will
use the code
variable.isdigit() to check
to see if it is a whole number. If it is
a whole number, add it to a list box,
otherwise clear the entry box. Add
another button that will clear the
list.
